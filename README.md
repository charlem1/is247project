Bar Check-In Project (subject to change)

The goal of our project is to create a check in system for a club. This check in system would count people entering and leaving the club and would also track the tabs of customers leaving should they have one. This would be achieved through an electronic armband system. An app that's installed on the customer's smartphone, or an electronic wristband that the customer keeps after leaving. If the customer is pre-registered through this app, the website, or a VIP system, they will get into the club faster. If not, they will receive a one time, paper armband that will make it more difficult to do certain things. It is a premium club after all. This wristband/app can be used at the bar to verify age, and orders made. Being a VIP member grants your even quicker access to the club, and occasional free drinks and discounts. You must be of age to become a VIP member. The check out process is as simple as the check in process. All you need to do is scan your wristband/smartphone and you'll be able to leave the club. It will alert you of any outstanding balances and how long you have until interest starts to take place.
